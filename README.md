# Expense Manager üë©‚Äçüíª

Expense Manager is a Flutter application designed to help users manage their daily, weekly, and monthly expenses efficiently. The app utilizes SQLite for local data storage through the `sqflite` package and implements state management using the `GetX` package.

## Features

- **Add Expenses**: Easily add new expenses to keep track of your daily spending.
- **Edit Expenses**: Update or modify existing expenses as needed.
- **Delete Expenses**: Remove expenses that are no longer relevant.
- **View Summary**: Get a clear summary of your expenses, organized by week or month.
- **Graphical Representation**: View your expenses in graphical form for a better understanding of your spending patterns.
- **Local Notifications**: Receive reminders through local notifications when you open the app.

## Why GetX?

We use GetX for state management because it offers a lightweight and highly efficient solution with minimal boilerplate code. GetX provides:
- **Reactive Programming**: Easily manage the UI state with reactive variables that automatically update when their values change.
- **Dependency Injection**: Simplify the process of managing dependencies across the app.
- **Navigation**: Streamline navigation and routing within the app without the need for context.
